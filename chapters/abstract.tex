Modern datasets nowadays contain a significant amount of unlabeled data, presenting challenges in deriving valuable insights. Recent advancements in contrastive learning techniques, such as SimCLR \cite{simclr} and t-SimCNE \cite{tsimcne}, have demonstrated efficacy in this context, particularly for visualizing large datasets and extracting meaningful insights. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often struggle with the requirements for large batch sizes and extensive computational resources, and they may fail to provide clear and distinct 2D visualizations without using GPUs.

To address these limitations, this thesis introduces optimization technique called AUC-CL to enhance the existing t-SimCNE framework. We conducted a comparative analysis of the modified algorithm, assessing its effectiveness through 2D graphical representations and evaluating its performance across various batch sizes using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier. As a result, our enhanced algorithm can make clear visualizations with smaller batch sizes.
